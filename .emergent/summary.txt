The AI engineer's work trajectory outlines the development of SheetGenie, an AI-powered spreadsheet application, from a frontend-only replica to a fully functional full-stack product. Initially, the focus was on replicating the visual design of  using React and TailwindCSS, including a Handsontable-like grid and a chat panel. After successfully building the frontend clone and demonstrating its visual fidelity, the scope expanded to implement backend AI functionality using FastAPI and OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) for spreadsheet operations like calculations and chart generation. The development then iteratively addressed user feedback, enhancing AI responses (bullet points, detailed insights), integrating Google Sheets, and debugging issues related to chat panel visibility, chart rendering, and direct AI question answering. The most recent work involves enabling column manipulation (add/delete) via AI, encountering and beginning to fix frontend rendering errors when complex data structures are returned.

The primary goal is to build SheetGenie, a SaaS application that clones the visual design, UI/UX, and layout hierarchy of . This includes pixel-perfect replication of design, colors, typography, and interactive elements like hover effects and loading states. The application should be frontend-only initially, mocking data.

Core functionality for SheetGenie includes:
1.  **File Upload**: Users can upload  files.
2.  **Interactive Grid**: Data is displayed in a Handsontable-like grid.
3.  **Chat Panel**: A right-side chat panel accepts plain English queries.
4.  **AI Integration**: OpenAI's  is used with function-calling to decide on helper functions.
5.  **Spreadsheet Helpers**: Functions like , , , ,  are executed.
6.  **Real-time Updates**: The Handsontable grid updates after AI execution.
7.  **Chart Visualization**: If requested, charts are rendered underneath the grid.
8.  **Download Modified Workbook**: Users can download the modified workbook.

Subsequent user requests expanded the scope to:
*   Implement full backend functionality with real AI capabilities.
*   Improve AI response formatting (bullet points, detailed trends, statistical insights).
*   Integrate Google Sheets: Allow users to paste a Google Sheets link to fetch and analyze data, instead of uploading Excel files.
*   Enable AI to directly answer specific data questions rather than creating pivot tables for everything.
*   Ensure accurate and visible chart generation, specifically for multi-series comparisons (e.g., Q1 vs Q2 sales).
*   Allow the AI assistant to add or delete columns in the spreadsheet.

<pending_tasks>
-   The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing and fixing the add or delete columns in the sheet functionality, specifically addressing a frontend rendering error where the AI returned objects that the frontend couldn't display.
-   The main UI () still has issues opening the chat panel directly, as observed with the Try Chat Assistant and AI Assistant buttons. The  component, while functional when forced, is not integrated seamlessly with the main  flow.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user's explicit request to enable the AI assistant to add or delete columns in the spreadsheet data.

The user reported an error: i asked the agent to add a column to the sheet with value 10% higher than q2 sales for each product it gave me this errors. cant i ask assitant to add or delete columns in the sheet. This indicates that while the intent for column manipulation was understood by the AI, the execution resulted in an error where the frontend couldn't properly render the returned data, specifically stating that it received objects instead of strings.

The AI engineer's current approach involves:
1.  **Adding Column Manipulation Functions in Backend**: Implementing  and  functions within . The  function is designed to create a new column with values derived from existing data (e.g., 10% higher than Q2 sales).
2.  **Integrating New Functions into AI Service**: Adding these new column manipulation functions as callable tools for the AI agent in  to allow the LLM to invoke them based on user queries.
3.  **Implementing Execution Handlers**: Ensuring the  can correctly execute these new functions and process their outputs.
4.  **Re-adding Missing Export Function**: The  function was re-added, suggesting it might have been inadvertently removed or modified during previous changes. This is crucial for users to download modified workbooks.

The last action in the trajectory shows the AI engineer has just finished adding the implementation for column operations in  and has added back the  function. The next step would be to restart the backend and test these new capabilities, while also being mindful of the reported frontend rendering issue that needs to be addressed for these operations to be visible to the user.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will restart the backend to apply the latest changes for column manipulation, then test the AI's ability to add and delete columns, specifically addressing the frontend rendering of returned data.
